This is a POC for a web shop made how the Web was intended to be used: mostly HTML, styled with static CSS, and JavaScript only where absolutely necessary <s>(but still not required)</s>(yeah, i use js to prefill locked text fields, because users are stupid. you could unlock the text field, but people would always manage to change them accidentally.).

It sends order details to a backend (currently a 404 page on example.com), which would then do more things, like sending an invoice, because putting iframes to random US companies' webpages is against the idea of a simple website.
